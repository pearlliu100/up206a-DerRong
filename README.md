## Self Introduction
Hello, my name is Der-Rong Liu (劉德容), you can call me Pearl. I come from Taipei, Taiwan, and moved to LA last year for grad school! I did my bachelor's in real estate and built environment, focusing on real estate development and city planning geographically in Taipei. I'm a first-year MURP, concentrating in Transportation Policy and Planning and Design and Development. I am interested in the intersection of urban design and transportation policy and hope to improve active transportation to serve communities without mobility.

## Course Description
This course will focus on introducing spatial analytical tools that could be used to solve the current urban planning issues. Learning more of the logic behind these quantitative tools can improve our critical thinking and give us a more compressive view of an issue. Through learning Python, the scripting language incorporated into GIS, we could have a holistic view of geoprocessing.

## Course Objectives
* Improve ability to analyze data spatially
* Better understanding of coding language in order to apply to future data science software
* Comprehend the fundamental concepts of GIS and its functions
* Know how to make a professional and detailed map using GIS
* Apply the knowledge of GIS into future projects

## Project Ideas
### GIS for TOD
* Indentify areas for Transit-Oriented Development in Los Angeles
  * Analyze data to produce statistics on existing population, employment, housing and transportation characteristics for each potential       TOD area, and identify stations that would benefit from optimizing TOD.
* Measure existing TOD in Los Angeles
  * Measure TOD levels considering functional, economic and built environment aspects. For example, densities, level of mixed use.
### GIS for measure of spatial health disparity
* identify neighborhoods with the spatial disparity of health care access
