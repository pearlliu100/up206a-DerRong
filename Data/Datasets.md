## Transit Stations by LA Metro
Description: This source shows all bus/rail/bike transit stations served by LA Metro, updated March 2016. Since the Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning define TOD as approximately a ¼ mile radius to ½ mile radius from the transit stations, so having the datasets of all transit stations is important.
